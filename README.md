# Tattoo-studio-with-concurrent-programming

# The problem consists of programming the Esperta problem and making it work in a competitor. It must be implemented in C, with each of the professionals implemented by through one thread and another thread must be used for arriving customers. Service can be
# simulated using the usleep() function, generating a random value between MINATEN and MAXATEN, representing the time in minutes it takes for a professional to perform a service. The arrival of a customer must be random, and at each 100-minute interval there must
# be between 1 and 10 customers.

# When a customer arrives, you must define what they want to do. To do so, you must generate a random number between 0 and 1. If the number generated is less than or equal to PAT, the client wants to carry out consultation with a tattoo artist. Otherwise, he wants
# the services of a body piercer. Remember to start the random number generator in order to generate different sequences of numbers for each run.
